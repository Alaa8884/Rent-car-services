# Rent Car Services Website

## About Project
Developed a complex, scalable frontend for a rental car platform. Leveraged React to build a dynamic and responsive user
interface, enabling users to seamlessly filter, select, and customize their rental experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
